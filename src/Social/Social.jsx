            Over the past two centuries cooperatives had been introduced to the
            world and ever since, the term cooperative has been developed in
            various form in different sectors in which human survival activities
            take places, meaning the environment of socio-economic and political
            aspect. They are usually an association of organized groups of
            people, organizations, or countries who/which share same values and
            objectives, willing to work together in order to achieve a defined
            or shared vision.

            The roots of cooperatives historically are traced in Europe in 19th
            century as their origin before they spread to other developed
            countries. Undoubtedly, the creation and growth of these
            cooperatives was portrayed as a tool to eradicate the delicate
            situation of absolute poverty and to advance country's economy. It
            is simply and normal to find cooperatives in different sectors like
            agriculture, mineral, industries and service sectors as they are
            entrusted in performing an excellent role of enhancing the
            livelihoods of rural residents in many developing countries.

            Kenya as one of African countries to have cooperatives' development
            long history in comparison to other sub-Saharan and east African
            countries like Rwanda, has proven cooperatives to be the driver of
            its growth, and indicated that they have made the main contributions
            to the overall economy after its independence. In 2009, the Kenya
            Ministry of Development and Marketing confirmed that 80% of Kenya's
            citizen was earning its income from cooperatives' practices directly
            or indirectly.

            In 2004, it was highlighted that in Africa; not less than 40% of the
            families are affiliated in cooperative communities (Schwettmann,
            2004). In Rwanda particularly there are 10,981 cooperatives
            registered currently with 5,293,090 members (Rwanda Cooperative
            Agency, 2022) who make also the 40 percent of the whole Rwanda
            population of 13 Million (World Bank, 2022). In this respect the
            cooperative movement is regarded to be the continent important
            non-governmental organisation (NGO).

          <p className="text-1xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            An International Labour Organisation (ILO) reports in 1998
            highlighted that cooperatives lift up a huge package in economic
            growth and job creation promotion. This because cooperatives are
            production companies in which their members create their own
            employment, as well as services' providers to their members.
          </p>

          <p className="text-1xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Based on the statistics of ILO study in 1997, it was estimated that
            in 15 African countries the cooperative sector was the main source
            of around 160000 direct jobs created (Wanyama, Develtere & Pollet
            2008), later on in 2015 cooperatives have accomplished a significant
            contribution to the economy of Africa by forging 5.6 million jobs
            and 2.1 million cooperative led occupations (ICA, 2022).

            It is evident that all the aforementioned facts from cooperatives
            intervention combined together can be the source of rural
            sustainable livelihood in gender context when considering the
            disadvantaged population in rural areas especially women who rarely
            participate in many of development activities based on various facts
            including extreme poverty, being blocked by cultural and social
            right in they are silenced by high pressure of men surroundings as
            well inability to economic access. Such assumption of cooperatives
            potentials might be supported by the case of India as an example, in
            which the country’s first women cooperative federation has risen
            from 33 to 103 member cooperatives of various types and sizes where
            member cooperatives’ collective income has levelled up 295% since
            2005, and 65,985 women have improved and increased livelihoods
            whereas in country like Philippines 1.4 million individuals and over
            7.2 million dependants are safeguarded under micro insurance
            policies and among these policyholders more than 70% are women
            (Jo‐Anne Ferguson, 2012) who frequently perceived to be
            marginalized.
